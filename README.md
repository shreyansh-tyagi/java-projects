## *@SpringBootApplication*
* @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning.

## *@RestController*
* RestController is used for making restful web services with the help of the @RestController annotation. This annotation is used at the class level and allows the class to handle the requests made by the client.

## *@Autowired*
* The @Autowired annotation provides more fine-grained control over where and how autowiring should be accomplished. The @Autowired annotation can be used to autowire bean on the setter method just like @Required annotation, constructor, a property or methods with arbitrary names and/or multiple arguments.

## *@GetMapping*
* The @GetMapping annotation is a specialized version of @RequestMapping annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod. GET) . The @GetMapping annotated methods in the @Controller annotated classes handle the HTTP GET requests matched with given URI expression.

## *@Override*
* The @Override annotation indicates that the child class method is over-writing its base class method. The @Override annotation can be useful for two reasons. It extracts a warning from the compiler if the annotated method doesn't actually override anything. It can improve the readability of the source code.

## *@Service*
* @Service annotation is used with classes that provide some business functionalities. Spring context will autodetect these classes when annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning is used.

## *@Configuration*
* @Configuration annotation indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.

## *@Bean*
* In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.
* Spring @Bean annotation tells that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. It is a method-level annotation. During Java configuration ( @Configuration ), the method is executed and its return value is registered as a bean within a BeanFactory .
